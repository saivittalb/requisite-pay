# Requisite Pay

A tool built for making your client pay you by adding opacity to the body tag and decrease it every day until their site completely fades away.

## Usage

- Just load the req-pay.js file in the <head> tag.
- Set a Due & a Deadline period.

Wordpress Version plugin available [here](https://github.com/saivittalb/requisite-pay-wp).

### Note:

- The plugin will only work if the due date and deadline are provided :)
